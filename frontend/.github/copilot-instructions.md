## Project Overview
This is a modern React TypeScript catering website featuring sophisticated line art aesthetics with blueprint overlays and selective color schemes. The design is inspired by complex AI art that blends traditional Indian cultural motifs with modern technical drawing elements.

## Key Design Principles
1. **Line Art Aesthetic**: Detailed line drawings, cross-hatching, and sketch-style elements
2. **Blueprint Overlays**: Technical drawing grid patterns and architectural elements
3. **Selective Color**: Strategic use of blue (#2563eb) and warm yellow (#f59e0b) accents
4. **Cultural Fusion**: Indian traditional elements combined with modern technical aesthetics
5. **High Performance**: Optimized React components with TypeScript for reliability

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Icons**: React Icons for consistent iconography
- **Design System**: Custom components following line art principles

## Code Guidelines
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Follow React best practices with hooks and functional components
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Optimize performance with React.memo and useMemo where appropriate

## Component Structure
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, Navigation
- **Section Components**: Hero, About, Services, Chef, Contact
- **UI Components**: Buttons, Cards, Forms, Decorative Elements
- **Animation Components**: Motion wrappers and transitions
